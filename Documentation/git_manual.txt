github:
We have a repository on my computer (probably won't be used), on the web (origin) and on
the vlsi server.
Currenty on the vlsi repository everything under pulpenix (and only there) is tracked by git.
To run a git command you must be under Workarea/pulp/pulpenix.
The original version of pulpenix is now called pulpenix_no_git.
Sandbox is now integrated into the directory pulpenix and is updated on the origin too.

important commands:
ADD NEW FILE:
To add a new file first make it in the workarea, then type 
	git add <filename>
to add it to the index (local "changelist") then, note that after you do that a "snapshot" of the file is not yet tracked to the local git repository until you commit.

COMMIT:
to commit a file type: 
	git commit [<filename or directory name> |-a] [ -m "commit message"]
This commits all changes done to the file or to the directory (recursively to all the 
directories under it) or all recent changes if you use -a.
You should either add the -m "commit message" and type a descriptive message, or if you don't,
it will open an editor by default and make you add a comment.

AMEND:
If you want to make changes to the description of a commit you just made do:
	git commit --amend
it will prompt the vim editor, add your comment there.
to push the comment fix do
	git push --force

LOG:
if you want to watch a file's history type
	git log <example.txt>
for example, if you type git log riscv_id_stage.sv you'll get:

commit 95fb5e2b6774b7dfbe3192d8c80c819e6dadee60 (HEAD -> master)
Author: avi <avikoriat@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 7 21:59:49 2019 +0300

    commit to sync with origin

(the last line was my commit message)

do 
	git log
to get all recent commits. --oneline shows a concise view of all of them.

PUSH:
After you commit, to push the commits you made onto the origin type:
	git push
that's it.

PULL:
to pull a branch to the vlsi server type:
	git pull origin <branch name>
this could make a problem if you have files in your working directory which have identical names to files
on the origin, but aren't on your local repository to solve it first type:
	git add --all
or
	git add -A
and then rerun the pull command.
