Pulpenix (nickname for PULP-Enics) is a Enics SOC research platform primarly based on the 
open-source PULP platform provided by  https://www.pulp-platform.org/ 
More specifically the initial Pulpenix version is based on the PULP Pulpino SOC flavor,
A minimal single-core SoC integrating the RI5CY RISC-V implementation.

Additionally, Pulpenix also support a HW/SW (Hardware/Software) co-design environment,
which is developed and maintained by Enics, this currently include support of an Eclips based  SW debug environment 
currently running with the platform HW simulation. 

Getting Started: 

1. Open a terminal the same file system you are capable running cadence irun command :

2. go to your preferred work-space within this file system  and perform following steps

3. mkdir pulp # root workspace folder for all your pulp/pulpenix activity
              # It is important to use exactly this folder name and structure
              # some scripts may depend on it
              
4. cd pulp 

5. mkdir toolchain

   cd toolchain
   Download and un-tar this file, which is RISCV toolchain already built for a Centos platform, hopefully it should work well also for RedHat
   https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/releases/download/v7.2.0-2-20180110/gnu-mcu-eclipse-riscv-none-gcc-7.2.0-2-20180111-2230-centos64.tgz
   
   [There is also a way to build the toolchain from its sources, but this is challenging and may takes hours to days to acomplish]
   
   # Removing un-needed level of hierarchy for Enics reference environment compatibility
   
   toolchain> mv gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc/7.2.0-2-20180111-2230  gnu-mcu-eclipse/
   toolchain> rm -r gnu-mcu-eclipse/riscv-none-gcc     
   
6. clone from the project github https://github.com/michaelperl/PULPenix_ceu and untar

7. cd pulpenix 

8. ls

   # you should have following folders    

   src  - Pulpenix design and test-bench sources (mostly system verilog)
   sim  - Where Simulation takes place   
   apps - Where SW applications are coded and maintained 
   misc - Some documents and setup files  
  
9. setup your environment:

   Execute following command, consider adding it to your ~/.bashrc:
   
   source misc/genpro_pulpenix_setup.sh
   
10. Lets compile "Hello World"
   
   our_pulp_compile helloworld     # takes you to helloworld app's folder, compiling the AES commands, and right after the other commands.
   
   When you're compiling apps that not contain AES commands, you can also compile as follows:

   cd  $MY_PULP_APPS/helloworld    # go to the hellowotld application folder

   cat helloworld.c                # take a quick look at code and comments
   
   pulp_comp_app_noopt helloworld  # Actually compiling the program

   
11. Now lets Simulate the program   
   
   cd $MY_PULP_IRUN                # move to the simulation directory
   
   pulp_get_app helloworld         #  configure simulation to run the hello-world application
   
   pulp_irun                       
   
   Will compile the Pulpenix and Testbench Verilog model
   Lots of compilation messages will show up (mostly only first time you run the command)
   eventually  "Hello World" will be printed.

12. You perform steps 10,11 using a script aliased to our_pulp_run. The script requires the program 
being run is in a folder with the same name.
Similarly, you can perform step 10 by using the script aliased to our_pulp_compile

13. Any changes we made we wrote a comment with dado wrapped around it (or inline)
